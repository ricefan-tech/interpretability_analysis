# Diagnostic Analysis of Model Behavior

This repository contains a cleaned version of a past technical interview
assignment. The goal of the work is not to maximize model performance, but
to understand model behavior through diagnostic analysis.

The notebook focuses on:
- identifying spurious or misleading correlations
- examining non-linear and temporal structure in the data
- highlighting limitations of proxy objectives and aggregate metrics
- using complementary evaluations (e.g. bucketed errors, horizon-dependent metrics)
  to reason about model robustness

The included dataset is a small, anonymized sample sufficient to reproduce
the analysis in the notebook.
